# titanic_project
This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival based on features such as age, sex, class, and more. Using machine learning techniques, the model classifies whether a passenger survived or not. Evaluation metrics like accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix are used to assess performance.
